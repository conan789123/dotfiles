abstract = {We make a case that a thread scheduler for heterogeneous multicore systems should target three objectives: optimal performance, core assignment balance and response time fairness. Performance optimization via optimal thread-to-core assignment has been explored in the past; in this paper we demonstrate the need for balanced core assignment. We show that unbalanced core assignment results in completion time jitter and inconsistent priority enforcement; we then present a simple fix to the Linux scheduler that eliminates these problems. The second part of the paper addresses the problem of building the HMC scheduler that balances all three objectives. This is a difficult optimization problem. We introduce a definition of this scheduling problem in terms of these three objectives and present a blueprint for a self-tuning algorithm based on reinforcement learning that maximizes a performance function that is an arbitrary weighted sum of these three objectives. Implementing and evaluating this algorithm is the subject of our future work.},

@article{Jensen1985,
abstract = {Process scheduling in real-time systems has almost invariably used one or more of three algorithms: fixed priority, FIFO, or round robin. The reasons for these choices are simplicity and speed in the operating system, but the cost to the system in terms of reliability and maintainability have not generally been assessed. This paper originates from the notion that the primary distinguishing characteristic of a real-time system is the concept that completion of a process or a set of processes has a value to the system which can be expressed as a function of time. This notion is described in terms of a time-driven scheduling model for real-time operating systems and provides a tool for measuring the effectiveness of most of the currently used process schedulers in real-time systems. Applying this model, we have constructed a multiprocessor real-time system simulator with which we measure a number of well-known scheduling algorithms such as Shortest Process Time (SPT), Deadline, Shortest Slack Time, FIFO, and a fixed priority scheduler, with respect to the resulting total system values. This approach to measuring the process scheduling effectiveness is a first step in our longer term effort to produce a scheduler which will explicitly schedule real-time processes in such a way that their execution times maximize their collective value to the system, either in a shared memory multiprocessing environment or in multiple nodes of a distributed processing environment.},

Our main contributions are twofold. First, we establish a condition for ensuring a tardiness of at most one quantum under EPDF. This condition is very liberal and should often hold in practice. Second, we present simulation results involving randomly-generated task sets, including those that do not satisfy our condition. In these experiments, deadline misses were rare, and no misses by more than one quantum ever occurred.},

abstract = {Classical scheduling abstractions such as deadlines and priorities do not readily capture the complex timing semantics found in many real-time cyber-physical systems. Time utility functions provide a necessarily richer description of timing semantics, but designing utility-aware scheduling policies using them is an open research problem. In particular, scheduling design that optimizes expected utility accrual is needed for real-time cyber-physical domains. In this paper we design scheduling policies that optimize expected utility accrual for cyber-physical systems with periodic, non-preemptable tasks that run with stochastic duration. These policies are derived by solving a Markov Decision Process formulation of the scheduling problem. We use this formulation to demonstrate that our technique improves on existing heuristic utility accrual scheduling policies.},

@article{Vengerov2007,
abstract = {This paper presents a general framework for performing adaptive reconfiguration of a distributed system based on maximizing the long-term business value, defined as the discounted sum of all future rewards and penalties. The problem of dynamic resource allocation among multiple entities sharing a common set of resources is used as an example. A specific architecture (DRA-FRL) is presented, which uses the emerging methodology of reinforcement learning in conjunction with fuzzy rulebases to achieve the desired objective. This architecture can work in the context of existing resource allocation policies and learn the values of the states that the system encounters under these policies. Once the learning process begins to converge, the user can allow the DRA-FRL architecture to make some additional resource allocation decisions or override the ones suggested by the existing policies so as to improve the long-term business value of the system. The DRA-FRL architecture can also be deployed in an environment without any existing resource allocation policies. An implementation of the DRA-FRL architecture in Solaris 10 demonstrated a robust performance improvement in the problem of dynamically migrating CPUs and memory blocks between three resource partitions so as to match the stochastically changing workload in each partition, both in the presence and in the absence of resource migration costs.

abstract = {This paper presents a general methodology for online scheduling of parallel jobs onto multi-processor servers in a soft real-time environment, where the final utility of each job decreases with the job completion time. A solution approach is presented where each server uses Reinforcement Learning for tuning its own value function, which predicts the average future utility per time step obtained from completed jobs based on the dynamically observed state information. The server then selects jobs from its job queue, possibly preempting some currently running jobs and "squeezing" some jobs into fewer CPUs than they ideally require to maximize the value of the resulting server state. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of the proposed approach. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},
